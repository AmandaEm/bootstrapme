# bootstrapme
For this project you will make an informational HTML page that has:

An article focused on the topic of your choosing
1 h1 element and at least 3 subheadings of any size

Images (>=2) related to your topic (unsplash.com has images you could use)

A table covering some information related to your topic

A form intended to collect visitors’ information for a newsletter
You do not actually need to write the article during this exercise! (Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet . . .)

I expect you to use your knowledge of semantic HTML to ensure that your page is accessible, SEO friendly, and approachable by other developers
or use the premade html site i have created for you or the html site you have made earlier in the cohort.
be sure to add the Link to bootstrap 
You must add:
            a navbar
            cards (one for each section)
            an offcanvas component
            be creative and do as much as you can with bootstrap
Your team will need 1 coordinator, 1 presenter, and 1 scribe to write compile the team’s HTML into one document. Everyone is expected to contribute to the final product!

You have 45 minutes to complete this exercise with your team. Good luck.

When we reconvene I will ask each group to share what they came up with!
